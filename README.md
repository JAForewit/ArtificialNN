# Neural-Net
This repository is a refactored artificial neural network written in Java (Adapted from Flinn Eggers).

**The Goal:** implement and succesfuly train an ANN.

**End Result:** I completed the proejct and optimized a few operations. This was a great learning experience and has led to the birth of a new project: [Layerless Neural Network](https://www.github.com/JAForewit/LayerlessNN).
