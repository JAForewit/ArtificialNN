# Neural-Net
Refactored Neural Network in Java (Adapted from Flinn Eggers)

**The Goal:** Create a generalized neural network that can be fed varying inputs that could be applied to many situations.

Specifically, this will be used for creating strategic AIs for custom games.

Next process:
Implimenting Strassen's Algorithm to improve the network at high loads and neuron numbers. In theory this could improve the Big-O of the network.
